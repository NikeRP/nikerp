I want to address to some personalities who forced comments to my YouTube channel, watering me with shit, saying I'm asking for money for the model.
I sincerely send you to where my eyes are looking - my opinion of you has not changed, just like yours about me, most likely.
All the rest of the gratitude for a long wait and patience - you're the best. Thank you and such as you.

If you want to use certain parts of my modification, please include me in the authors. You do not difficult - I am pleased.
Always yours, MrEverest.
